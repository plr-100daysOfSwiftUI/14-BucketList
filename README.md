### Challenges

1. Our + button is rather hard to tap. Try moving all its modifiers to the image inside the button – what difference does it make, and can you think why?
2. Having a complex if condition in the middle of ContentView isn’t easy to read – can you rewrite it so that the MapView, Circle, and Button are part of their own view? This might take more work than you think!
3. Our app silently fails when errors occur during biometric authentication. Add code to show those errors in an alert, but be careful: you can only add one alert() modifier to each view.
